Hello,

this project has the goal to create a beautiful backend for the Websitebaker 2.8 and higher.

To reach this goal I want to keep the workflow that websitebaker provides but improve the design and maybe also some core-functions.

The Goal is:

- to provide clean and valid markup (less tables mor div)
- enhance th workflow of the user
- give hints to the user (Like tooltips)
- clean UI (less buttons, more editing space)
- to replace the old backend with this one... for everyone

Actual in development: [+ ready; -in work]
 + Right now the settings do not work because of the new tabs [fixed] shell be featured in 0.2
 - design of settingstab
   Should be much prettyer, less gray?


version 0.1
 + New Navigation
 + enhanced startpage
 + Better possibility of addding a Page
 

ToDo:
 - general design. Right now It looks like google, thats good because the user will recognise this and I think facebook and google can not be wrong using a top navigation. But still... we do not copy
 - Loginpage
   I think nice Images could make the startpage more usefull.
 - Images for Startpage
 - Warningspage
 - CSS (make ist readable)
 - possibility to change colors easyly (future)
   with different stylesheets or for the user to change (?)
 - Create a help
   So that unexperianced user can use WB more efficent.
   I thought I will create tooltips that guide trough WB?
