Hello,

this project has the goal to create a beautiful backend for the 
Websitebaker 2.8 and higher.

To reach this goal I want to keep the workflow that websitebaker provides
but improve the design and maybe also some core-functions.


The Goal is:

- to provide clean and valid markup (less tables mor div)
- enhance th workflow of the user
- give hints to the user (Like tooltips)
- clean UI (less buttons, more editing space)
- to replace the old backend with this one... for everyone


version 0.1
 + New Navigation
 + enhanced startpage
 + Better possibility of addding a Page
 

ToDo:
 - Loginpage (in work)
 - Images for Startpage
 - Warningspage
 - CSS (make ist readable)
 - possibility to change colors easyly (future)
 - Create a help
   So that unexperianced user can use WB more efficent
